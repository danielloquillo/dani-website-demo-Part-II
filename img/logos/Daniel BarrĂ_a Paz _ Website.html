        <h1>I consider myself a person in constant learning.
            My hobbies are surfing,
            playing soccer with my friends from work and reading a good book or paper.

                    <h2>Surf</h2>

                    <p>
                        I was born and raised in Chile, a country that has a long coastline for surfing.
                        Every time we had the chance, my friends and I would go surfing at "la boca" beach,
                        Concon-Chile. It is a sport that I miss playing a lot since I now find myself living
                        in the state of Ohio where there are no beaches. I hope one day to pick up the surfboard
                        again and jump into the waves.I take surfing as a philosophy of life, where the waves are
                        the setbacks of life that sometimes turn you around but you have to keep going, you have to
                        keep paddling!

                    <h2>Soccer</h2>
                    <img src="./Daniel BarrA&#774;_a Paz _ Website_files/Soccer.jpg" alt="soccer">
                    <p>
                        I grew up playing soccer. In Latin America it is a very popular sport,
                        like American football here in the United States. You don't need many implements
                        and you don't have to be a Messi or Ronaldo to be able to play, just a ball
                        and good friends. Every weekend I get together with friends from work to play soccer,
                        we play for about two hours or until we drop.

                    <p>
                        I like to read books that tell stories of improvement,
                        of how people were able to achieve their goals or their purposes.
                        Books that tell the keys to how people were able to overcome certain
                        obstacles in their lives or I find it very interesting.
